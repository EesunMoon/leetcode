    Given an array arr[] of size n, 
    the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 
    such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum. 
    
    If there is a set S with n elements, 
    then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, 
    Subset2 must have n-m elements 
    and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.
